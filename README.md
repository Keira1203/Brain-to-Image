# Brain-to-Image
Exploratory research on reconstructing visual information from EEG signals.

## About
This repository is a personal research log.
I am exploring how visual information perceived by humans
can be reconstructed from EEG signals using machine learning.

## Background
- Currently studying Data Science / AI
- Interested in Neurotech, BCI, and Image Generation
- This project is exploratory and experimental

## Current Status
- Learning EEG data structures
- Exploring Kaggle EEG datasets
- Reviewing related papers

## Planned Steps
- EEG preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Mapping EEG → latent space
- Image reconstruction experiments

## Notes
Progress updates will be added weekly.
