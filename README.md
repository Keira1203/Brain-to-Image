# Brain-to-Image
Exploratory research on reconstructing visual information from EEG signals.

## About
This repository is a personal research log.
I am exploring how visual information perceived by humans
can be reconstructed from EEG signals using machine learning.

## Background
- Currently studying Data Science / AI
- Interested in Neurotech, BCI, and Image Generation
- This project is exploratory and experimental

## Current Status
- Learning EEG data structures
- Exploring Kaggle EEG datasets
- Reviewing related papers

## Planned Steps
1. EEG preprocessing (filtering, artifact removal)
2. Feature extraction
3. Mapping EEG → latent space
4. Image reconstruction experiments

## Notes
Progress updates will be added weekly.

## Week1: Environment setup
- Installed Python 3.11 and created virtual environment
- Installed MNE, numpy, scipy, matplotlib
- Set up JupyterLab and fixed path / permission issues
- Goal: be able to run MNE tutorials locally

## Week2
### learning phase
- Visualized evoked responses
- Plotted EEG signal traces (butterfly plots) and learned how to highlight channels and time　points of interest
- Plotted scalp topographies using both single-time-point data and time-averaged data
- Visualized arrow maps to represent spatial signal patterns
- Created joint plots combining butterfly plots and scalp topographies
